### GraphQL Tech Overview

#### ðŸ§  Why? 

This repo is supposed to cover a few touch points in regards to overall understanding of the technolog. It will cover a tutorial from the documentation, link to graphql documentation, and a side-project with the use of building a graphql based API. 


#### ðŸ¦„ What? 

For my implementation for graphql, I will have project folders that are comprised of one python project, one python tutorial using graphene, and any additional notes or documentation. My framework of choice is going to be django rest framework due to its speed for getting setup quickly.
